## Let me summarize what I've happened  :

1. You worked on the data of survivors from the famous Titanic ship disaster.
2. Your goal was to identify the passenger classes most likely to have survived that incident.
3. You built and tested several predictive models, including:
   - An SVM model using a linear kernel, which achieved an accuracy of 77.65%
   - An SVM model using a polynomial  kernel, which achieved an accuracy of 81.63%
   - An SVR model using a polynomial   kernel, which achieved an accuracy of 22.12%
   - and more ather in Notebook 
4. Before building the models, you performed Dummification to convert some non-numerical features into numerical representations.

This provides a clearer picture of the steps you took in this project. It seems you experimented with comparing different SVM models, and the model using the polynomial kernel was the most suitable for the Titanic disaster data.
